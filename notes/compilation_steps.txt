Compilation process is conversion of C source file to object file.
This process takes in four stages

Pre-processing
  Includes the include files
  Removes the comments
  Expands the macros, inline functions
  Conditional compilation

Compilation
  Generates a pseudo assembly language code which does not correspond to any microprocessor

Optimization
  Optimize the code based on the registers of the microprocessor
  Generates assembly language instructions for a particular microprocessor

Assembling
  Converts the assembly instructions to machine op-codes
